/*

------------------------- Hooks ---------------------------
-> With hooks we can use class component features like state, lifeCycle, pure component etc.
 Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. 


1. useState :- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
              State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an 
              application.

2. useEffect :- Basically useEffect is a combination  of componentDidMount , 
                componentDidUpdate, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount
